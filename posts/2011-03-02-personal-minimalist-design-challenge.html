title: Personal Minimalist Design Challenge
tags: design, challenge, simple, kiss, minimalist

I am often inspired by minimalist [web designs](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)/code. The [simplicity](http://biven.org/) is [beautiful](http://obensonne.bitbucket.org/index.html).

I'm not the type of designer that likes complicated and frilly designs; in fact, I'm not really a designer at all, but I like to think I can design. I have given myself a challenge:

> Create a copy of this site that only uses CSS to control whitespace, not color or size.

We'll see how it goes and what I come up with. Once that's done, and I'm satisfied, I'll play with color, but in a very minimal way, of course.
