title: The Secret to Blogging
tags: blogging, habits

Today, as I was riding my bike to work, I realized that I must turn blogging into a habit if I want to create a successful blog.

I've been reading a great e-book about productivity: "[Zen to Done](http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/)". It's easy to read and what's written makes a lot of sense. The most important thing I've learned is that to be productive/successful you must form habits. I thought blogging would become easier if I made it a habit and decided I could probably find posts by bloggers to back this up. Lo and behold, I found three.

The secret to blogging, at least when starting out, is making it a habit, a habit of posting.
