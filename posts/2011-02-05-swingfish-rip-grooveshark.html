title: SwingFish - Rip Grooveshark
tags: grooveshark, ripper

SwingFish is a tiny app with one function: to download songs from [Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com). Check out [the screenshot and download it](/swingfish.html).

## Making it ##

Writing SwingFish was simple:

1.  Use Wireshark to sniff the traffic.
2.  Create a stand-alone app to display Grooveshark.
3.  Add a little code to rip the songs.

That's really all there was to it. (This same technique works with Pandora too...)
