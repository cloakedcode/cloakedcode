title: The Launch of App Garden
tags: appgarden, web app

App Garden is a place where people can share their web/mobile/desktop application ideas. Once an idea has been posted, other users can vote it up or down.

## Why? ##

I built App Garden because I was having trouble coming up with ideas to implement. If ideas are so common (i.e. "a dime a dozen") then there are plenty to spare and no one will mind sharing them. If an idea becomes really popular, and I like it, I might make it a reality.
