title: Web Design for Developers
tags: design, coding, web

I'm a programmer by trade, not a graphic designer. I use my left-brain all the time. That's what programming is all about, thinking. But design isn't the same kind of thinking, it's right-brained. When you look at a beautiful work of art, you are struck by its beauty, how it makes you feel.  

For a long time I've wished I could create amazing web pages that draw the viewer in, but as a programmer my approach to design is too left-brained. After spending three days googling and reading I've discovered something wonderful: I _can_ design.

## Design is not innate ##
Graphic design is as much learned as programming. Like all skills it's not an innate ability. Designers aren't born great, they learn to be great. Design is not purely the ability of knowing what looks good, but also analyzing designs and knowing _why_ they are appealing. 
There's a talk titled ["Design for Developers"](http://blip.tv/file/3685673/) that goes into detail about learning what makes designs good. (And how programming and designing aren't all _that_ different.) Do not fear designing, it's possible for all to learn, if they take the time.

## The basics ##
There is a lot to learn and graphic design theory is a huge realm, just like that of programming design patterns and methodologies. There are [great resources](http://psd.tutsplus.com/articles/web/50-totally-free-lessons-in-graphic-design-theory/) for learning all the theory you could ever want to know. But when it all comes down to it, all the knowledge in the world won't make you an amazing designer. To become great you must practice and experiment.

## Practice makes beautiful ##
Once you've learned the theory you have to put that knowledge to use. But don't think just because you know all there is to know about design you'll churn out perfect designs. No, you must practice. Was your first program perfect? No, of course not, it was filled with bugs. But you kept learning and your coding got better, perhaps to the point of [greatness](http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/HowToBeAProgrammer.html). Now take that drive you have to become the best programmer you can be, and apply it to graphic design.

## Start your engines ##
With enough practice there should be nothing you can't design. There's [a](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/158769/best-books-to-learn-about-design) [lot](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/133341/improve-web-design-skills) we have to [learn as developers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/514083/why-is-good-ui-design-so-hard-for-some-developers) about [designing for the web](http://designingfortheweb.co.uk/book/index.php) so get started!
