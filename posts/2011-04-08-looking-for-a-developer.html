title: Looking for a Developer?
tags: about, clients

In an attempt to discover what I wanted from this site, I grabbed a Moleskine and started writing. I came to a happy realization of what I want. Knowing what you want removes any feeling of being lost. Aaahh, how gratifying. And exciting! The photo explains it all, but suffice it to say I'm looking for a fellow developer/entrepreneur to partner with. Anything from Mac desktop apps to web apps. If you have an idea and want another pair of highly skilled hands to bring it to fruition, [contact me](/contact.html), I don't care how. Just get in touch, and let's talk!
