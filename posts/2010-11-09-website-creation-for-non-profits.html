title: Website Creation for Non-profits
tags: non-profit, cms, idea

I currently work for two non-profits, and [neither](http://ihn-cos.org) of [them](http://www.westsidecares.org) have good web sites.

## Problem ##

Most non-profits don't have a web designer/developer on staff and can't afford to hire a professional.

## Solution ##

I will develop a CMS that someone with little to no knowledge of how websites work can use to create, and maintain, a site for their non-profit.

 * The administration interface must be dead-simple.
 * All actions must be "[undo-able](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/neveruseawarning/)".
 * Tweaking the site design must be dead-simple for designers.

This idea is still "under development". I've been thinking for a couple days about what problem I want to solve. If I solve this one, my jobs will become much easier. Especially since one of the non-profits I work for is considering overhauling their website.
