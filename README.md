# Cloaked Code - The code/content for my site

## What is this?

The code/content in this repo is everything that it takes to run my site. All content is contained in static files. The posts are stored in the [posts](/cloakedcode/cloakedcode/tree/master/posts/) directory and the pages in [pages](/cloakedcode/cloakedcode/tree/master/pages/).

## Why not use a pre-built CMS?

Where is the fun in that? Other than the pure fun of creating my own "CMS":

 * This is so fast it's almost like riding a cheetah.
 * The entire site can be copied/backed-up in a jiffy.
 * If someone wants to read the posts offline, they just have to download [them](/cloakedcode/cloakedcode/tree/master/posts/).
 * It's less than 300 lines of code (including the CSS but excluding [Acorn](/cloakedcode/cloakedcode/tree/master/app/acorn.php)).
 * It does exactly what I want and no more.
