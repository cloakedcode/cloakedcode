# RadioBox #

RadioBox is a remake of an app I made years ago for family and friends, but this time I'm releasing it to the world for all to enjoy. RadioBox displays [Pandora's](http://pandora.com) mini player in a window and downloads the songs that it plays.

## Features ##

 * Songs are in the tiny M4A format (fully compatible with iPods).
 * Songs are tagged with title, artist, and album.
 * Songs include high-quality album art from LastFM, when possible.
 * When you mark a song "Thumbs down", the downloaded copy is deleted.

## Download ##

As with [MPlayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu), check your local laws before using this app.
