title: About Me

I'm an enterprising guy. I learned computer programming at a young age and have been coding ever since. For the longest time it was purely a hobby. Then I did volunteer work for a couple people, and they paid me out of the goodness of their hearts. It remained a hobby for a couple more years and then I got hired doing PHP programming for a web design shop. The people were great and I got to maintain their in-house CMS. I have since left that job and do computer work for two non-profits that serve homeless families and individuals.

I've done everything from creating Mac desktop applications, to developing iPhone apps, to creating web apps. I've learned lots of programming languages; let's just say, unless it's an obscure language, I've probably used it.

### My Goal ###
I want to make a living as a freelance programmer. This site is the first step in that process. Right now I'm working on a new hosting panel/server for [AmbitiousLemon](http://ambitiouslemon.com).
