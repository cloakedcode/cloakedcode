The screenshot really says it all. (Hint: Look at the little window.) In case you like words more than pictures, here's a quick description of the app. SwingFish downloads songs from [Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com) as the songs play.

## Features ##

 * Songs are in the MP3 format (great for iPods).
 * Songs are tagged with title, artist, album, and whatever other tags the songs were given before being uploaded to Grooveshark.

## Download ##

As with [MPlayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu), check your local laws before using this app.

[Download it now](/apps/swingfish/swingfish_latest.zip). <small>(Requires OS X 10.5 or greater.)</small>

### Windows/Linux ###

SwingFish is not compatible with Windows or Linux. Check out [Groovedown](http://groovedown.me/) which can download songs from Grooveshark on those platforms.
