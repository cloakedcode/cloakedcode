# Portfolio

Below are several projects to which I have contributed. If you're looking for code samples, check out the [Code](/code.html) page.

## AmbitiousLemon

[AmbitiousLemon](http://ambitiouslemon.com) is a non-profit, free, webhost for open source/freeware developers, students, non-profits, artists, and just about anyone else who wants to have a website but isn't selling anything.

I volunteered several years ago to rewrite the administration backend. I tore apart the original PHP code and reshaped it with Congo (the predecessor of [Acorn](http://github.com/cloakedcode/Acorn), my PHP framework). It's still running that code from 2009.

### Features

* A multi-part application form for web hosting that can be saved at any point and picked up where it was left off.
* Admins can moderate the applications, ask follow-up questions of the applicants, and comment on the applications.
* Admins can add, edit, and categorize application questions.
* Users can be created and edited.
* User profiles contain skills, email address, and other standard fields.
* Skills can be created, edited, and deleted by admins.
* Many other features...

## AppGarden

AppGarden was a project where people could post ideas and vote them up or down. Similar in style to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or [Reddit](http://reddit.com).

### Features

* Written in PHP using [Acorn](http://github.com/cloakedcode/Acorn).
* Idea text was rendered as [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
* Users could register and recover their password if they forgot.
* Registered users could up/down vote ideas.

## TreeHouse

TreeHouse was a project to give [Forrst](http://forrst.com) users a page they could link to as a "profile" or personal page. It scraped accounts that were linked to their Forrst profile and offered the content posted to each of those sites under their own tabs.

### Features

* Mostly written with [jQuery](http://jquery.com).
* Made use of the Forrst API to gather profile data.
* Queried Forrst for username based on URL (e.g. http://treehouse.com/{USERNAME}).

## URL Shortener

I built a [URL shortener](http://sna.la/s/) to accompany [my short personal domain name](http://sna.la).

### Features

* Shortens URLs (e.g. [http://sna.la/~b](http://sna.la/~b)) and recognizes when those URLs are visited.
* Tracks IP addresses of visitors to the short URLs.
